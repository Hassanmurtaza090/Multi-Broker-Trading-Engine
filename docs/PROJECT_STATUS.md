## Completed Work

- Repository directory structure created (monorepo layout).
- Root `AGENTS.md` (permanent agent rules) authored.
- `.gitignore` and `.env.example` (placeholders only) authored.
- Project memory documentation authored (this file, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE,
  REQUIREMENTS, DECISIONS, TEST_STATUS, CHANGELOG, DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW).
- Backend foundation scaffolded (package layout, dependency management,
  lint/format/type-check/test configuration).
- Frontend foundation scaffolded (React + TypeScript + Vite, lint/format/test
  configuration).
- Docker foundation scaffolded (compose + backend/frontend/postgres structure).
- Initial test infrastructure created (tests validate the project foundation
  only — no application behavior yet).
- Backend foundation verified (pytest, ruff, mypy all pass).
- Frontend foundation verified (vitest, tsc, ESLint, vite build all pass).
- **M1 — Core Domain Model implemented** in `backend/domain`:
  - `money.py` — `Currency`, `Money`, `Quantity`, `Price` (Decimal-based,
    immutable value objects).
  - `instrument.py` — `Instrument`, `AssetClass`, `Exchange`, `InstrumentType`.
  - `orders.py` — `OrderSide`, `OrderType`, `TimeInForce`, `OrderStatus`
    (lifecycle state machine), `Order`, `OrderRequest`.
  - `account.py` — `Account`, `Balance`, `CashBalance`.
  - `position.py` — `Position` (signed quantity, VWAP via `apply_fill`).
  - `fills.py` — `Fill`, `ExecutionReport`, `ExecutionReportType`.
  - `portfolio.py` — `Portfolio` aggregation.
  - `market.py` — `MarketQuote`, `QuoteType`.
  - `errors.py` — typed `DomainError` hierarchy + stable error codes.
- **M2 — Event System implemented** in `backend/events`:
  - `base.py` — `DomainEvent` base (stable `__event_type__`, `__event_version__`).
  - `envelope.py` — `EventEnvelope` (`event_id`, `event_type`, `event_version`,
    timezone-aware `timestamp`, `source`, `correlation_id`, `causation_id`,
    typed `payload`).
  - `bus.py` — `EventBus` protocol + `InProcessEventBus` (reentrancy-safe
    per-bus total ordering, sequential handler dispatch, handler isolation,
    structured observability).
  - `registry.py` — `EventRegistry` (version-keyed `(event_type, version)` → class).
  - `serialization.py` — `EventSerializer` (envelope ↔ JSON-safe dict).
  - `types.py` — concrete event types (market data, order lifecycle,
    position lifecycle, account, broker connectivity, risk).
  - `docs/EVENTS.md` — full event catalog with per-event semantics.
- **M3 — Market Data Engine implemented**:
  - `domain/market.py` — added `MarketTick`, `Bar`, `BarInterval` (OHLCV bar
    invariants, non-negative volume, single-currency checks).
  - `brokers/base/market_data.py` — `MarketDataFeed` port with `RawQuote`,
    `RawTick`, `RawBar` payloads (implemented by IBKR/Saxo in M8/M9).
  - `market_data/engine.py` — `MarketDataEngine`: normalizes/validates raw
    feed payloads into domain value objects and publishes
    `MarketQuoteUpdated` / `MarketTickUpdated` / `MarketBarUpdated` on the M2
    event bus.
  - `market_data/subscription.py` — `SubscriptionManager`: idempotent,
    ref-counted feed subscriptions.
  - `market_data/staleness.py` — `StalenessMonitor`: stale-data detection
    (TS-007) with injectable clock.
  - `events/` — added `MarketTickUpdated` and `MarketBarUpdated` event types.
- **M4 — Order Management System implemented**:
  - `domain/orders.py` — added `Order.filled_quantity` (M1-deferred),
    `remaining_quantity`, `apply_fill_quantity`, `mark_pending_submit`.
  - `domain/errors.py` — added `OrderStateError` (code `CONFLICT`).
  - `order_management/manager.py` — `OrderManager`: create/submit/cancel/
    modify/apply execution reports with event publication, idempotency
    (`client_order_id` / `idempotency_key`) and duplicate-`report_id`
    protection.
  - `order_management/repository.py` — `OrderRepository` port +
    `InMemoryOrderRepository`.
  - `events/` — added `OrderModified` event type.
- **M5 — Execution Engine implemented**:
  - `brokers/base/execution.py` — `ExecutionBroker` port +
    `ExecutionReportHandler` (implemented by IBKR/Saxo in M8/M9).
  - `execution/engine.py` — `ExecutionEngine`: submit/cancel/modify through the
    broker, apply reports to the OMS (which publishes `order.*` events), handle
    timeouts (state unchanged), bounded connection-loss retry, and
    `reconcile()` for reconnection (TS-006).

> No broker, risk, or portfolio P&L logic has been implemented yet (M6+).

## Blockers

- None.

## Known Technical Debt

- None at this stage (no application services or broker integration exists
  yet; M1 domain, M2 event system, M3 market data, M4 OMS, and M5 execution have
  no known defects).
- `frontend` npm dependencies report 4 advisories from the deprecated ESLint 8
  toolchain (build-time only); to be addressed when tooling is upgraded.
- The OMS uses an in-memory `OrderRepository`; a PostgreSQL implementation
  arrives with the infrastructure milestone (ADR-010).
- Event bus ordering is guaranteed only within a single `InProcessEventBus`
  instance on a single event loop. Cross-process/distributed ordering and a
  retry/dead-letter mechanism are intentionally deferred (ADR-007).
- Real broker adapters (IBKR/Saxo) are not yet implemented; M3/M5 use simulated
  feed/broker. Adapters arrive in M8/M9 via the `MarketDataFeed` /
  `ExecutionBroker` ports (ADR-009, ADR-011).

## Current Architecture State

M1 domain model is implemented in `backend/domain` (broker-agnostic, no
infrastructure/framework imports — enforced by tests). The M2 event system in
`backend/events` is broker- and framework-agnostic: domain logic depends on the
`EventBus` protocol, and the `InProcessEventBus` transport is swappable without
rewriting domain/application layers. The M3 market-data engine in
`backend/market_data` depends only on the `MarketDataFeed` port
(`backend/brokers/base`), the domain, and the event system. The M4 OMS in
`backend/order_management` depends only on the domain (`Order` state machine),
the event bus, and its `OrderRepository` port. The M5 Execution Engine in
`backend/execution` depends only on the `ExecutionBroker` port, the domain, and
the OMS. Architecture boundaries hold: domain, events, market_data,
order_management, and execution do not import FastAPI, React, SQLAlchemy, or any
broker. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/EVENTS.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Last Verified Test Status

See `docs/TEST_STATUS.md` for the authoritative record.

- Latest result (M5, 2026-09-15): backend 232/232 tests pass; `ruff check`,
  `mypy` (strict, 39 files), and `ruff format` all clean. Quant, Security, QA,
  and Architect reviews: PASS. M0+M1+M2+M3+M4 regression: PASS (217/217).
